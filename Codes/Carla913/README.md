# CARLA Simulator


This folder is intentionally left empty due to the fact that the CARLA simulator can be directly downloaded by yourself from [CARLA's official site](https://carla.org/).

Note that the version used in this research is `CARLA 0.9.13`. So the AutoSceneGen framework is compatible with versions equal to or above `CARLA 0.9.13`.

You can place your CARLA simulator here.

The folder structure can be:

```txt
