 The video shows a car driving on the highway with its trunk open. A mattress can be seen bouncing around in the trunk. The car is driving in the left lane and there is a car in the right lane. The car in the right lane is trying to pass the car with the open trunk. The car with the open trunk speeds up and the car in the right lane cannot pass. The car in the right lane then swerves into the left lane, almost hitting the car with the open trunk. The car with the open trunk then pulls over to the side of the road.
