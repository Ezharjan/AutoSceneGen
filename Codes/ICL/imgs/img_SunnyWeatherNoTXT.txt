 It's a sunny day and you're driving down the road. The sun is shining brightly and it's making it difficult to see. You squint your eyes and try to focus on the road ahead. You're starting to get a headache and you feel like you're going to be sick. You pull over to the side of the road and get out of your car. You take a few deep breaths and try to relax. You close your eyes and the sun disappears. You open your eyes and the sun is still there, but it's not as bright. You get back in your car and start driving again. You're still feeling a little sick, but you're able to focus on the road better. You make it to your destination and you're relieved to be out of the sun. You go inside and take a nap. When you wake up, you're feeling much better. You're glad that you were able to pull over and rest.
