 This is a sandstorm. Sandstorms are common in dry and arid regions, such as the Middle East and North Africa. They are caused by strong winds that pick up sand and dust from the ground and carry it through the air. Sandstorms can be dangerous, as they can cause respiratory problems and reduce visibility.
